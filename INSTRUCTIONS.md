# Java EE 7 Hands-on Lab with GlassFish 4
The Java EE 7 platform continues the ease of development push that characterized prior releases by bringing further simplification to enterprise development. It adds new and important APIs such as the REST client API in JAX-RS 2.0 and the long awaited Batch Processing API. Java Message Service 2.0 has undergone an extreme makeover to align with the improvements in the Java language. There are plenty of improvements to several other components. Newer web standards like HTML 5, WebSocket, and JSON processing are embraced to build modern web applications.

This hands-on lab will build a typical 3-tier end-to-end application using the
following Java EE 7 technologies:

* Java Persistence API 2.1 ([JSR 338](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338))
* Java API for RESTful Web Services 2.0 ([JSR 339](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=339))
* Java Message Service 2.0 ([JSR 343](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=343))
* JavaServer Faces 2.2 ([JSR 344](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=344))
* Contexts and Dependency Injection 1.1 ([JSR 346](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=346))
* Bean Validation 1.1 ([JSR 349](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=349))
* Batch Applications for the Java Platform 1.0 ([JSR 352](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=352))
* Java API for JSON Processing 1.0 ([JSR 353](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=353))
* Java API for WebSocket 1.0 ([JSR 356](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=356))
* Java Transaction API 1.2 ([JSR 907](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=907))

Together these APIs will allow you to be more productive by simplifying enterprise development.

## 1. Software Requirement	
The following software needs to be downloaded and installed:
* [Java JDK 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [NetBeans 7.3](http://netbeans.org/downloads/) (*All* or *Java EE* version)
* [GlassFish 4.0 b89](http://dlc.sun.com.edgesuite.net/glassfish/4.0/promoted/glassfish-4.0-
b87.zip)

Configure GlassFish 4 in NetBeans IDE following the instructions in Appendix A.

## 2. Problem Statement	
This hands-on lab builds a typical 3-tier Java EE 7 Web application that allows customers to view the show timings for a movie in a 7-theater cineplex and make reservations. Users can add new movies and delete existing movies. Customers can discuss the movie in a chat room. Total sales from each howing are calculated at the end of the day. Customers also accrue points for watching movies.

![app_flow](images/app_flow.png "Figure 1 - Application flow")

**Figure 1 - Application flow**

*Figure 1* shows the key components of the application. The User Interface initiates all the flows in the application. Show Booking, Add/Delete Movie and Ticket Sales interact with the database; Movie Points may interact with the database, however, this is out of scope for this application; and Chat Room does not interact with the database.

The different functions of the application, as detailed above, utilize various Java technologies and web standards in their implementation. *Figure 2* shows how different Java EE technologies are used in different flows.

![app_flow_figure_2](images/app_flow_figure_3.png "Figure 2 - Technologies Used in the Application")

**Figure 2 - Technologies Used in the Application**

<b>Flow</b>      | <b>Description</b>
-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------
User Interface   | Written entirely in JavaServer Faces (JSF).
Show Booking     | Uses lightweight Enterprise JavaBeans to communicate with the database using Java Persistence API
Add/Delete Movie | Implemented using RESTful Web Services. JSON is used as on-the-wire data format.
Ticket Sales     | Uses Batch Applications for the Java Platform to calculate the total sales and persist to the database.
Movie Points     | Uses Java Message Service (JMS) to update and obtain loyalty reward points; an optional implementation using  database technology may be performed.
Chat Room        | Utilizes client-side JavaScript and JSON to communicate with a WebSocket endpoint

**Table 1 - Technologies Used in the Application**

## 2.1. Lab Flow	
The attendees will start with an existing maven application and by following the instructions and guidance provided by this lab they will:

* Read existing source code to gain an understanding of the structure of the application and use of the selected platform technologies
* Add new and update existing code with provided fragments in order to demonstrate usage of different technology stacks in the Java EE 7 platform.

This is not a comprehensive tutorial of Java EE. The attendees are expected to know the basic Java EE concepts such as EJB, JPA, JAX-RS, and CDI. The Java EE 6 Tutorial is a good place to learn all these concepts. However enough explanation is provided in this guide to get you started with the application.

### Disclaimer
This is a sample application and the code may not be following the best practices to prevent SQL injection, cross-side scripting attacks, escaping parameters, and other similar features expected of a robust enterprise application. This is intentional such as to stay focused on explaining the technology. It is highly recommended to make sure that the code copied from this sample application is updated to meet those requirements.

## 3. Walk­‐through of Sample Application

### Purpose
This section will download the sample application to be used in this hands-on lab. A walk-through of the application will be performed to provide an understanding of the application architecture.

#### 3.1. Git clone the [Java EE 7 Hands On repository](http://github.com/glassfish/javaee7hol) on GitHub. 
This repository comes with a starting code application named <code>movieplex7</code>.

<code>$ git clone git@github.com:glassfish/javaee7hol.git</code>

#### 3.2. Open Project In NetBeans IDE
Select *File > Open Project...*, select the movieplex7 directory, and click on *Open Project*. The project structure is shown in *Figure 4*.

![project_structure](images/project_structure.png "Project Structure")

##### Attention
While opening the project, NetBeans may prompt you to create a configuration file to configure the base URI of the REST resources bundled in the application. The application already contains a source file that provides the needed configuration. Click on *Cancel* to dismiss this dialog.

#### 3.3. Maven Coordinates
Expand *Project Files* and double click on <code>pom.xml</code>. In the pom.xml, the Java EE 7 API is specified as a <code>dependency</code>:

```xml
<dependencies>
   <dependency>
     <groupId>javax</groupId>
     <artifactId>javaee-api</artifactId>
     <version>7.0-b87</version>
   </dependency>
<dependencies>
```

This will ensure that Java EE 7 APIs are retrieved from Maven. Notice, a specific version number is specified and this must be used with the downloaded GlassFish 4.0 build. 

The Java EE 6 platform introduced the notion of “profiles”. A profile is a configuration of the Java EE platform targeted at a specific class of applications. All Java EE profiles share a set of common features, such as naming and resource
injection, packaging rules, security requirements, etc. A profile may contain a proper subset or superset of the technologies contained in the platform.

The Java EE Web Profile is a profile of the JavaEE Platform specifically targeted at modern web applications. The complete set of specifications defined in the Web Profile is defined in the Java EE 7 Web Profile Specification. GlassFish can be downloaded in two different flavors – Full Platform or Web Profile.

This lab requires Full Platform download. All technologies used in this lab, except Java Message Service and Batch Applications for the Java Platform, can be deployed on Web Profile.

#### 3.4 Default Data Source
Expand “Other Sources”, <code>src/main/resources</code>, <code>META-INF</code>, and double-click on <code>persistence.xml</code>. By default, NetBeans opens the file in Design View. Click on Source tab to view the XML source.	

It looks like:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<persistence version="2.0"
   xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence"
   xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence 
                       http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_0.xsd">
   <persistence-unit name="movieplex7PU" transaction-type="JTA">
     <!--
     <jta-data-source>java:comp/DefaultDataSource</jta-data-source>
     -->
     <properties>
       <property name="javax.persistence.schema-generation.database.action"
                 value="drop-and-create"/>
       <property name="javax.persistence.schema-generation.create-source"
                 value="script"/>
       <property name="javax.persistence.schema-generation.create-script-source"
                 value="META-INF/create.sql"/>
       <property n ame="javax.persistence.sql-load-script-source"
                value="META-INF/load.sql"/>
       <property name="eclipselink.deploy-on-startup"
                 value="true"/>
       <property name="eclipselink.logging.exceptions"
                 value="false"/>
     </properties>
   </persistence-unit>
</persistence>
```

Notice <code><jta-data-source></code> is commented out, i.e. no data source element is specified. This element identifies the JDBC resource to connect to in the runtime environment of the underlying application server.

The Java EE 7 platform defines a new default DataSource that must be provided by the runtime. This pre-configured data source is accessible under the JNDI name:

<code>java:comp/DefaultDataSource</code>

The JPA 2.1 specification says if neither <code>jta-data-source</code> nor <code>non-jta-data-source</code> elements are specified, the deployer must specify a JTA data source or the default JTA data source must be provided by the container. For GlassFish 4, the default data source is bound to the JDBC resource <code>jdbc/__default</code>. Clicking back and forth between “Design” and “Source” view may prompt the error shown below:

![figure_6](images/figure_6.png "Figure 6 - Missing Server Problem Error Message")

This will get resolved when we run the application. Click on “OK” to dismiss the dialog.

#### 3.5 Schema Generation
JPA 2.1 defines a new set of <code>javax.persistence.schema-generation.*</code> properties that can be used to
generate database artifacts like tables, indexes, and constraints in a database
schema. This helps in prototyping of your application where the required artifacts
are generated either prior to application deployment or as part of
<code>EntityManagerFactory</code> creation. This feature will allow your JPA domain
object model to be directly generated in a database. The generated schema may
need to be tuned for actual production environment.
The <code>persistence.xml</code> in the application has the following
<code>javax.persistence.schema-generation.*</code> properties. Their meaning and
possible values are explained in Table 2.

<b>Property</b>              | <b>Meaning</b>               | <b>Values</b>
-----------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------
javax.persistence.schema-generation.database.action | Specifies the action to be taken by the persistence provider with regard to the database artifacts. | "none", "create","drop-and-create", "drop”
javax.persistence.schema-generation.create-source | Specifies whether the creation of database artifacts is to occur on the basis of the object/relational mapping metadata, DDL script, or a combination of the two.    | “metadata”, “script”, "metadata-then-script”, “script-then-metadata”
javax.persistence.schema-generation.create-script-source | Specifies a java.IO.Reader configured for reading of the DDL script or a string designating a file URL for the DDL script | 
javax.persistence.sql-load-script-source | Specifies a java.IO.Reader configured for reading of the SQL load script for database initialization or a string designating a file URL for the script. | 

**Table 2 - JPA Schema Generation Properties**

Refer to the [JPA 2.1 Specification](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338) for a complete understanding of these properties.

In the application, the scripts are bundled in the WAR file in <code>META-INF</code> directory. As the location of these scripts is specified as a URL, the scripts may be loaded from outside the WAR file as well.

Feel free to open <code>create.sql</code> and <code>load.sql</code> and read through the SQL scripts. The database schema is shown in Figure 7.

![figure_7](images/figure_7.png "Figure 7 - Database Schema")

**Figure 6 - Database Schema**

This folder also contains <code>sales.csv</code> which carries some comma-separated data used later in the application.

#### 3.6. JPA Entities, Stateless EJBs, and REST endpoints
Expand *Source Packages*. The package <code>org.glassfish.movieplex7.entities</code> contains the JPA entities corresponding to the database table definitions. Each JPA entity has several convenient @NamedQuery defined and uses Bean Validation constraints
to enforce validation. 

The package <code>org.glassfish.movieplex7.rest</code> contains stateless EJBs corresponding to different JPA entities.

Each EJB has methods to perform CRUD operations on the JPA entity and convenience query methods. Each EJB is also EL-injectable (<code>@Named</code>) and published as a REST endpoint (<code>@Path</code>). The <code>AplicationConfig</code> class defines the base path of REST endpoint. The path for the REST endpoint is the same as the JPA entity class name. 

The mapping between JPA entity classes, EJB classes, and the URI of the corresponding REST endpoint is shown in Table 3.

<b>JPA Entity Class</b> | <b>EJB Class</b> | <b>RESTful Path</b>
------------------------|------------------|--------------------
Movie | MovieFacadeREST | /webresources/movie
Sales | SalesFacadeREST | /webresources/sales
ShowTiming | ShowTimingFacadeREST | /webresources/showtiming
Theater | TheaterFacadeREST | /webresources/theater
Timeslot | TimeslotFacadeREST | /webresources/timeslot

**Table 3: JPA Entity and EJB Class Mapping with RESTful Path**

Feel free to browse through the code.

#### 3.7. JSF Pages
The file <code>WEB-INF/template.xhtml</code> defines the template of the web page and has a header, left navigation bar, and a main content section. <code>index.xhtml</code> uses this template and the EJBs to display the number of movies and theaters. <code>beans.xml</code> enables CDI injection in the WAR file.

Note, <code>template.xhtml</code> is in <code>WEB-INF</code> folder as it allows the template to be accessible from the pages bundled with the application only. If it were bundled with rest of the pages then it would be accessible outside the application and thus allowing other external pages to use it as well.

#### 3.8. Run the sample
Right-click on the project and select “Run”. This will download all the maven dependencies on your laptop, build a WAR file, deploy on **GlassFish 4**, and show the URL <code>[http://localhost:8080/movieplex7](http://localhost:8080/movieplex7)</code> in the browser.

During first run, the IDE will ask you to select a deployment server. Choose the configured GlassFish server and click on “OK”.

![select_deployment_server](images/select_deployment_server.png)

The output looks like as shown below:

![first_run](images/first_run.png)

#### 4. Show Booking (JavaServer Faces)

##### Purpose
Build pages that allow a user to book a particular movie show in a theater. In doing so a new feature of JavaServer Faces 2.2 will be introduced and demonstrated by using in the application.

JavaServer Faces 2.2 introduces a new feature called Faces Flow that provides an encapsulation of related views/pages with application defined entry and exit points. Faces Flow borrows core concepts from ADF TaskFlow, Spring Web Flow, and Apache MyFaces CODI.

It introduces <code>@FlowScoped</code> CDI annotation for flow-local storage and <code>@FlowDefinition</code> to define the flow using CDI producer methods. There are clearly defined entry and exit points with well-defined parameters. This allows the flow to be packaged together as a JAR or ZIP file and be reused. The application thus becomes a collection of flows and non-flow pages. Usually the objects in a flow are designed to allow the user to accomplish a task that requires input over a number of different views.

This application will build a flow that allows the user to make a movie reservation. The flow will contain four pages:

1. Display the list of movies
2. Display the list of available show timings
3. Confirm the choices
4. Make the reservation and show the ticket

**4.1** Items in a flow are logically related to each other and so it is required to keep them together in a directory.	

In NetBeans IDE, right-click on the “Web Pages”, select “New”, “Folder...”, specify the folder name “booking”, and click on “Finish”.

![create_new_folder](images/create_new_folder.png)

**4.2** Right-click on the newly created folder, select “New”, “Other...”, “JavaServer Faces”, “Facelets Template Client”, and click on “Next >”.

![faces_template_client](images/faces_template_client.png)

Give the File Name as “booking”. Click on “Browse...” next to “Template:”, expand “Web Pages”, “WEB-INF”, select “template.xhtml”, and click on “Select File”. Click on “Finish”.

In this file, remove <code>&lt;ui:define&gt;</code> sections with “top” and “left” names as these are inherited from the template.

![faces_template_client_name](images/faces_template_client_name.png)

**4.3** “booking.xhtml” is the entry point to the flow (more on this later). Replace the “content” <code>&lt;ui:define&gt;</code> section such that it looks like:

```xml
<ui:define name="content">
  <h2>Pick a movie</h2>
  <h:form prependId="false">
    <h:selectOneRadio value="#{booking.movieId}" layout="pageDirection" required="true">
      <f:selectItems value="#{movieFacadeREST.all}" var="m" itemValue="#{m.id}" itemLabel="#{m.name}"/>
    </h:selectOneRadio>
    <h:commandButton id="shows" value="Pick a time" action="showtimes" />
  </h:form>
</ui:define>
```

The code builds an HTML form that displays the list of movies as radio button choices. The chosen movie is bound to <code>#{booking.movieId}</code> which will be defined as a flow-scoped bean. The value of <code>action</code> attribute on <code>commandButton</code> refers to the next view in the flow, i.e. “showtimes.xhtml” in the same directory in our case.

Click on the hint (shown as yellow bulb) and click on the suggestion to add namespace prefix. Do the same for <code>c:</code> and <code>f:</code> prefix as shown below:

![xml_namespace_hint](images/xml_namespace_hint.png)

**4.4** Right-click on “Source Packages”, select “New”, “Java Class...”. Specify the class name as “Booking” and the package name as <code>org.glassfish.movieplex7.booking</code>.

#### 5.0	Chat	Room	(Java	API	for	WebSocket)

##### Purpose
Build a chat room for viewers. In doing so several new features of Java API for WebSocket 1.0 will be introduced and demonstrated by using them in the application.
WebSocket provide a full-duplex and bi-directional communication protocol over a single TCP connection. WebSocket is a combination of IETF RFC 6455
Protocol and W3C JavaScript WebSocket API (a Candidate Recommendation as of this writing). The protocol defines an opening handshake and data transfer. The API enables Web pages to use the WebSocket protocol for two-way 
communication with the remote host.JSR 356 defines a standard API for creating WebSocket applications in the Java EE 7 Platform. The JSR provides support for:
* Create WebSocket endpoint using annotations and interface
* Initiating and intercepting WebSocket events
* Creation and consumption of WebSocket text and binary messages
* Configuration and management of WebSocket sessions
* Integration with Java EE security model

This section will build a chat room for movie viewers.

**5.1** Right-click on “Source Packages”, select “New”, “Java Class…”. Give the class name as <code>ChatServer</code>, package as <code>org.glassfish.movieplex7.chat</code>, and 
click on “Finish”.

**5.2** Change the class such that it looks like:
<code>
@ServerEndpoint("/websocket")
public class ChatServer {
private static final Set<Session> peers = 
Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet<Session>());
@OnOpen
public void onOpen(Session peer) {
peers.add(peer);
}
@OnClose
public void onClose(Session peer) {
peers.remove(peer);
}
@OnMessage
public void message(String message, Session client) throws 
IOException, EncodeException {
for (Session peer : peers) {
if (!peers.equals(client))
peer.getBasicRemote().sendObject(message);
}
}
}
</code>
In this code:
* <code>@ServerEndpoint</code> decorates the class to be a WebSocket endpoint. The value defines the URI where this endpoint is published.
* <code>@OnOpen</code> and <code>@OnClose</code> decorate the methods that must be called when WebSocket session is opened or closed. The peer parameter defines the client requesting connection initiation and termination.
* <code>@OnMessage</code> decorates the message that receives the incoming WebSocket message. The first parameter, message, is the payload of the message. The second parameter, client, defines the other end of the WebSocket connection. The method implementation transmits the received message to all clients connected to this endpoint.

Resolve the imports. Make sure to pick java.websocket.Session instead of the default.

**5.3** In “Web Pages”, select “New”, “Folder…”, give the folder name as <code>chat</chat> and click on “Finish”.
**5.4** Create <code>chatroom.xhtml</code> in “chat” folder following the steps outlined in 4.2. 
Replace “content” <code><ui:define></code> section such that it looks like:

```xml
<ui:define name="content">
<form action=""> 
<table>
<tr>
<td>
Chat Log<br/>
<textarea readonly="true" rows="6" cols="50" 
id="chatlog"></textarea> 
</td>
<td>
Users<br/>
<textarea readonly="true" rows="6" cols="20" 
id="users"></textarea>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">
<input id="textField" name="name" value="Duke" type="text"/>
<input onclick="join();" value="Join" type="button"/>
<input onclick="send_message();" value="Send" 
type="button"/><p/>
<input onclick="disconnect();" value="Disconnect" 
type="button"/>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</form>
<div id="output"></div>
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" 
src="${facesContext.externalContext.requestContextPath}/chat/websocket.
js"></script>
</ui:define>
```
The code builds an HTML form that has two textareas – one to display the chat log and the other to display the list of users currently logged. A single text box is used to take the user name or the chat message. Clicking on “Join” button takes the value as user name and clicking on “Send” takes the value as chat message. JavaScript methods are invoked when these buttons are clicked and these are explained in the next section. The chat messages are sent and received as WebSocket payloads. There is an explicit 
button to disconnect the WebSocket connection.
“output” div is the placeholder for status messages. The 
WebSocket initialization occurs in “websocket.js” included at the bottom of the fragment.

![xml_namespace_hint](images/select_javascript_file_type.png)

**5.5** Right-click on “chat” in “Web Pages”, select “New”, “Web”, “JavaScript File”. 
Give the name as “websocket” and click on “Finish”.

**5.6** Edit the contents of “websocket.js” such that it looks like:

<code>
var wsUri = 'ws://' + document.location.host 
+ document.location.pathname.substr(0,
document.location.pathname.indexOf("/faces"))
+ '/websocket';
console.log(wsUri);
var websocket = new WebSocket(wsUri);
var username;
websocket.onopen = function(evt) { onOpen(evt); };
websocket.onmessage = function(evt) { onMessage(evt); };
websocket.onerror = function(evt) { onError(evt); };
websocket.onclose = function(evt) { onClose(evt); };
var output = document.getElementById("output");
function join() {
username = textField.value;
websocket.send(username + " joined");
}
function send_message() {
websocket.send(username + ": " + textField.value);
}
function onOpen() {
writeToScreen("CONNECTED");
}
function onClose() {
writeToScreen("DISCONNECTED");
}
function onMessage(evt) {
writeToScreen("RECEIVED: " + evt.data);
if (evt.data.indexOf("joined") !== -1) {
users.innerHTML += evt.data.substring(0, evt.data.indexOf(" 
joined")) + "\n";
} else {
chatlog.innerHTML += evt.data + "\n";
}
}
function onError(evt) {
writeToScreen('<span style="color: red;">ERROR:</span> ' + 
evt.data);
}
function disconnect() {
websocket.close();
}
function writeToScreen(message) {
var pre = document.createElement("p");
pre.style.wordWrap = "break-word";
pre.innerHTML = message;
output.appendChild(pre);
}
</code>

The WebSocket endpoint URI is calculated by using standard JavaScript variables and appending the URI specified in the ChatServer class. WebSocket is initialized by calling new WebSocket(…). Event handlers are registered for lifecycle events using onXXX messages. The listeners registered in this script are explained in Table	4.

**Table 4 - WebSocket Event Listeners**

<b>Listeners</b>      | <b>Called When</b>
-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------
onOpen(evt) | WebSocket connection is initiated
onMessage(evt) | WebSocket message is received
onError(evt) | Error occurs during the communication
onClose(evt) | WebSocket connection is terminated

Any relevant data is passed along as parameter to the function. Each method 
prints the status on the browser using writeToScreen utility method. The join
method sends a message to the endpoint that a particular user has joined. The 
endpoint then broadcasts the message to all the listening clients. The 
send_message method appends the logged in user name and the value of the 
text field and broadcasts to all the clients similarly. The onMessage method 
updates the list of logged in users as well.
